In this web application, I created a homepage with 4 franchises. Each franchise has it's own page with a functional map. You can type your zipcode into the map to find the restaurants of these franchises near you. You can give reviews for each site that will go into the database based on the place-id set by google.
The purpose of this application is for upper management in restaurants to understand performance between different locations of the same chain. For example, in Manhattan, there may be up to 10 different Starbucks locations within a few square miles. It is unideal for one location to have high food quality, yet lower customer service, whereas another location may have quite the opposite. The ideal franchise will want every location to provide equal service. 
This will be measured based on three distinct characteristics which will all be determined by feedback given by customers. These characteristics are cleanliness, food quality, and customer service. 
The ultimate goal is for upper management to uphold the same ideals at each of its locations throughout the chain. 
The business model for this application can easily be sustained by giving customers incentives to take the survey for a location, by ex. providing a coupon for a free drink with the purchase of a meal, or a free small scoop of ice cream.
